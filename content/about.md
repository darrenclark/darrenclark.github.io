I currently live and work in Toronto 🇨🇦 For much of my life I've been fascinated by
computers, software, and programming.

I'm currently building the social network for the AI era at [Kiid AI](https://kiid.ai/).

Before Kiid, I spent nearly ten years at [theScore](https://www.scoremediaandgaming.com/),
working on sports media, daily fantasy, and sports betting apps. And before that, my first
full time job was at [Fluik](https://fluik.com/), working on hit mobile games like
[Office Jerk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/office-jerk/id423593206).

Outside of software development, I'm passionate about the outdoors ⛰️, hiking 🥾,
rec sports 🏐 🥌 and learning new things!
